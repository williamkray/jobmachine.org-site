                Presumably, if you're reading this message it means that someone should be inviting you to the Job Machine "Space" (a space is a collection of rooms). Once you accept the invite, you should be prompted to join the "Spaces Beta", and you'll be able to view all the rooms we have on various topics. A few rooms are suggested to you in the left panel of the web-app, but feel free to join anything that sounds interesting!

                If you need help with anything, you can just ask me by saying !help.

                There's also a list of Frequently Asked Questions at https://www.jobmachine.org/faq.html

                If you have a question that isn't covered there, just ask in here! I'm sure the humans that participate in here would be able to answer your questions.

                Welcome aboard, we're happy to have you! If you haven't already, please introduce yourself to the folks in here who maybe don't know you.

                Greetings everyone. We've had some new people join as well as some folks drop since the class initially began. In the
                interest of casting the widest possible net, with an emphasis of creating more of a \"community\" feeling rather than a
                set of classes with a strict curriculum, I'd like to propose the following adjustments to the purpose of this channel
                and group.
                    1. Flexible schedule. Bias for attendance rather than consistency.
                    2. Multiple sessions on the same topic / chapter. Allow folks to attend a follow up session if they aren't able to make the first.
                    3. Condensed curriculum. Many of the chapters in the Haskell book can be condensed into single sessions. Decrease the number of sessions required for
                basic proficiency.
                    4. Emphasis on group projects. Rather than require everyone to do exercises in their own time, come up with a couple projects everyone can contribute to.
                    5. Multiple meeting \"types\".  Set up meetings with a particular emphasis. E.g.:
                        - \"Basics\" - bootstrap programmatic / conceptual intuition for some topic
                        - \"Category Theory\" - session on a particular Haskell concept through the lens of CT
                        - \"Practical\" - session focused on a practical use-case of a particular FP concept
                        - \"Philosophy\" - session focused on a meta-philosophical implications of particular concept (or set of concepts)
                        - etc...
                I've also created a survey as a means to gauge number of members and general proficiencies - https://forms.gle/HuSbuBWLcAwMxLPE9. Please fill this out if you want to participate.
