                    <h2>What IS Job Machine, anyway?</h2>
                  </header>
                  <p>
                    Job Machine started way back around 2012 as a Google Hangout chat amongst some co-workers.
                    Eventually, it expanded and needed a better platform, and migrated to Slack.</p>
                  <p>Between then and now, it has grown significantly, morphed, shed old users, and gained new ones,
                  eventually migrating to Matrix.</p>
                  <p>In Matrix, the Job Machine is a "Space", a collection of chat rooms of various topics. Each room
                  may have its own administrator and moderators, as well as membership rules, but for the most part all
                  rooms are available to join as long as you are a member of the Job Machine Space.</p>
                  <p>Anyone with a Matrix account is able to join our <a
                                                                          href="https://matrix.to/#/#waitingroom:jobmachine.org">Waiting
                                                                          Room</a>, where you can introduce yourself in
                  order to be invited to the Space. If your Matrix account is on the jobmachine.org homeserver, you will
                  be automatically added to the Waiting Room, but will still need to show signs of life and be invited
                  to the Space to participate in our other rooms.</p>
                  <p>Once you have joined the Job Machine Space, you can "Explore Rooms" of the space and join anything
                  that looks interesting! A few rooms are suggested as a place to get started, since it can be
                  overwhelming at first.</p>

                  <p>Job Machine is a private community, but we aim to make accessibility easy. Currently the Job
                  Machine Matrix server is open to federation, but all Job Machine-related rooms are only accessible to
                  members of the Space (a collection of rooms), with a few of our rooms still requiring invitation even
                  if you are a Space member. This means you can join with any Matrix account across the federated network and participate in Job Machine.</p>

                  <p>If you're joining us for the first time, welcome! Start by joining the
                  <code>#waitingroom:jobmachine.org</code> and introducing yourself to the admins, and they'll be able
                  to invite you to the Space.</p>

                    <h2>Is there a code of conduct?</h2>
                  </header>
                  <p>We have never needed any official Code of Conduct. Generally, because we're such a small group of
                  people, everyone gets to know everyone else and problems tend to work themselves out. However it is
                  worth saying that at a bare minimum the expectation is to treat everyone in Job Machine with
                  respect.</p>
                  <p><img class="image fit" src="images/billandted.gif" alt="BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER"></p>
                  <p>In the words of Bill and Ted: <em>BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER.</em></p>
                  <p>Additionally, our community is founded on interaction. Getting to know each other requires actually
                  talking to one another, and as such inactive members will occasionally be pruned from the community.
                  If you are removed from the Job Machine and want to rejoin the conversation, ask to be re-invited by
                  sending a message in the <code>#waitingroom:jobmachine.org</code>.</p>
                  <p>Repeat violators or "drive-by" members (folks who surface when they need help, but who generally do
                  not provide any substantive help back) may notice less success when asking to be re-invited, as their
                  behavior violates the "BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER" ideology.</p>

                  </header>
                  <p>If you forgot your password, you can reset it by visiting the <a href="https://element.jobmachine.org/">the web app</a> login page, and simply follow the links to reset your password. This requires that you have associated an email address with your account at some point in time... if you never have, you will need to reach out to an administrator to reset your password.<p>
                  <p>Resetting your password will cycle your encryption keys... basically that means that you won't be able to read any old messages in <a href="#encryption">encrypted rooms</a> unless you have another session logged in somewhere. If you do, you can export your encryption keys, and import them into your new sessions. For help, please reach out to an administrator.</p>

                  sessions. Within your user settings, there is an option to "Reset" your Encryption Secure Backup key.

                    <h2>How do I connect with a different client instead of the webapp?</h2>
                  </header>
                  <p>There are many Matrix clients for many platforms, with a decent collection of info at <a href="https://matrix.org/clients/" target="_blank">https://matrix.org/clients/</a>.</p>
                  <p>When connecting from another client, you will need to connect to whichever homeserver your account is associated with. If you have an account on <code>jobmachine.org</code>, that would look like this:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>User ID: <code>your-username</code></li>
                    <li>Matrix ID: <code>@your-username:jobmachine.org</code></li>
                    <li>Homeserver Address: <code>https://synapse.jobmachine.org</code></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Some clients are able to figure this out just by entering your full Matrix ID, others can't. For the easiest use, we recommend you just use the <a href="https://element.jobmachine.org/" target="_blank">web app</a> which will automatically connect you to the correct homeserver.<p>
                  <p>If you're having trouble, reach out to an admin in the <code>#waitingroom:jobmachine.org</code> and someone will help sort you out.</p>

                  <p>Matrix (the technology that powers Job Machine) supports very strong end-to-end encryption <i>if configured for the room in question</i>. Direct messages are encrypted by default, and several of our rooms are encrypted. However, many of our rooms are still bridged to a private Slack team, and that bridging would not work properly if encryption were enabled in those rooms.</p>
                  <p>To see if a room is encrypted, just look for a shield icon next to the room avatar!

                  <p>If you've been in any of our rooms, you've probably run into Cog, our resident bot (full matrix ID is <code>@cog:jobmachine.org</code>).</p>
                  <p>Cog can subscribe to RSS feeds, respond with an animated gif from Giphy.com, roll the dice, create polls, set reminders, and all kinds of other stuff. Just ask for help by saying <code>!help</code> in a room with Cog in it, and it will walk you through some other help commands.</p>
                  <p>Occasionally, Cog will have trouble recognizing you if you join an existing encrypted room. If you are unable to decrypt the messages that Cog is sending in that room, please let an administrator know in the <code>#waitingroom:jobmachine.org</code> and they'll give Cog a swift kick in the circuitboard.</p>

                  </header>
                  <p>No. The color of your nickname is determined by the client application using... <i>[checks notes]...</i> mysterious logic. You cannot change this unless you make changes to the code of the client application you are using.</p>

                  </header>
                  <p>Because matrix allows you to set your nickname separately from your matrix ID, there is a possibility that more than one person can have the same nickname in the same room. This would be very confusing for other people in the conversation, so matrix clients automatically show the full matrix ID to differentiate them.</p>
                  <p>If you have a conflicting nickname with someone else in the room, you are free to change your nickname so that it doesn't conflict with theirs, and the matrix client will not need to differentiate your accounts.</p>

                  to set your profile data specifically within the context of that room.</p>
                  <p>For example, if your nickname is normally "Foo", you can go to the job board room and use the
                  command:<br />
                  <code>/myroomnick Foo [looking]</code><br />
                  to change your nickname just in that room to indicate that you are actively looking for a new job.</p>

                  <p>Or in the cars room, you may want to use <code>/myroomavatar</code> to set your avatar to a picture
                  of your car. If you run the command just like that, it will open a file browser so you can upload a
                  picture right from there. If the image you want to use has already been uploaded to Matrix
                  unencrypted, you can also supply the MXC URI to the image, like this:<br />
                  <code>/myroomavatar mxc://jobmachine.org/SoMeRaNdOmGiBbErIsH</code><br />
                  If you don't know how to find an image's MXC URI, just ask an admin and they'll help you out!

                    <h2>I'm getting an "Unable to decrypt" error, but only for messages from a specific person in an
                      encrypted room. What's going on?</h2>
                  </header>
                  <p>
                  I cannot tell you how frustrating this bug has been for our community. Basically, sometimes your
                  client (the app you use) loses track of all the members of an encrypted room, and so it forgets to
                  send the keys to a few people. This key sending is how they're able to see your messages when you're
                  using encryption, so it's kind of a big deal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  If you encounter this issue, either you or the person sending the un-decryptable messages can fix it
                  <i>going forward</i> by either leaving the room and rejoining, or if you're on the web
                  application/desktop app, using the <code>/discardsession</code> command. <em>This will not magically
                    make it possible to decrypt the old, undecryptable messages!</em> This simply fixes the issue going
                  forward. To test, be sure to send (or have the offender send) some new messages to make sure everyone
                  can read them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  If you're a really cool person, before you do this step to fix it, you can use the
                  <code>/rageshake</code> command (or on mobile, literally shake your phone). This will prompt you to
                  send debug logs to the developers of Element, so they can see what is causing these issues. The more
                  logs we send them about this, the more likely they'll be able to fix it! If you are prompted to
                  associate your logs with a GitHub issue, use <a
                                                                   href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/6989">this

                    <h2>What's the deal with the Challenge Coin? What's a Coin Check?</h2>
                  </header>
                  <p>
                  If you are lucky enough (or if you've signed up for a <a href="../donate.html">monthly recurring
                    donation</a>), then you probably have a challenge coin. Why? What does it mean? What do I do with
                  it?</p>
                  <p>The challenge coin shows our logo on the obverse, the ten-toothed cog with a three-runged ladder in
                  the center.  The ten teeth were chosen to represent that Job Machine has been around in some form or
                  another for over ten years now, and the ladder represents the general "ladder of success" that we are
                  all climbing, whether that's financially, personally, or specific goals that we have.</p>
                  <p>On the reverse is an abstraction of a decentralized network, with multiple nodes connecting to each
                  other. This diagram also makes the shape of "JM" which stands for Job Machine. Surrounding this motif
                  is our slogan in Latin: <em>Communitas, Scientia, Salaria</em> (Community, Technology, Salary).</p> 
                  <p>As for the purpose of the Challenge Coin itself, the following is shamelessly stolen from <a
                                                                   href="https://signaturecoins.com">SignatureCoins.com</a>:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Sharing a challenge coin with a group is a time-honored tradition rooted in the nation’s military
                  representing teamwork, unity, and proof of exclusive membership.  However, forgetting your own coin
                  can be an expensive affair, potentially costing you a full round of drinks and an evening’s worth of
                  mockery.  Before letting that happen, you had best learn the five rules for keeping your challenge
                  coin handy for a “coin check.”</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li><p><strong>Initiating a “coin check” consists of a “challenge” and a “response.” </strong>If you
                    are the “challenger,” then you initiate a “coin check” by slamming your challenge coin onto a table
                    or bar. All other coin holders must then “respond” by drawing their coins out and slamming them down
                    as well or otherwise present their own challenge coins for public view.</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><p>Another acceptable form of challenge is holding your coin aloft and shouting “coin check”
                        or another verbal form of communicating your intent to challenge.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Depending on the circumstances, it is also acceptable to insistently tap your coin upon a
                        surface or otherwise make it audibly known you are initiating a challenge.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Points 1.1 and 1.2 may be preferable if you wish to remain in the good graces
                        of the bar owner or any owners of the surrounding table surfaces.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li><p><strong>Failing to respond to a “coin check” when challenged carries a penalty. </strong>Any
                    coin holder who fails to respond to a challenge with their own coin must buy a round of drinks to
                    everyone who successfully responded.</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><p>A penalty does not necessarily need to be a drink. It can take the form of any mutually
                        agreed upon service or item of consumption. Please refer to your own group’s specific rules on
                        the matter.</p></li>
                      <li><p>The other coin holders are free to mock you mercilessly. You may feel appropriate shame and
                        remorse for negligence at will.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Participants are allowed a single “freebie” if they genuinely did not know the rules prior
                        to a challenge. It is the responsibility of all other participants to fully explain the
                        rules.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Participants are allowed to take up to, but no more than, three steps away from their
                        position at the time of the initial challenge to retrieve their coin.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li><p><strong>Should every coin holder present successfully respond, then the challenger is
                      penalized.</strong> If you issue a challenge and all coin holders respond, then you must honor
                    your challenge by purchasing a round of drink to all participants.</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><p>Please refer to sections 2.1 and 2.2.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li><p><strong>A challenge may be issued at any time or place.</strong> So long as there are at least
                    two coin holders in immediate proximity to each other, a challenge may be issued at any time or
                    place.</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><p>Issuing a challenge in the middle of a (solemn) funeral, emergency, or shower officially
                        makes you a dick, and the rules of the “coin check” may or may not be honored. Locker rooms are
                        fair game.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li><p><strong>Losing, misplacing, or gifting away your challenge coin does not grant immunity.
                    </strong>Until your coin is replaced, you’re likely responsible for drinks whenever a “coin check”
                    is issued.</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><p>It is highly recommended you have your challenge coin replaced before word spreads you are
                        coinless.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                  </ol>
