                    <h2>What IS Job Machine, anyway?</h2>
                  </header>
                  <p>
                    Job Machine started way back around 2012 as a Google Hangout chat amongst some co-workers.
                    Eventually, it expanded and needed a better platform, and migrated to Slack.</p>
                  <p>Between then and now, it has grown significantly, morphed, shed old users, and gained new ones,
                  eventually migrating to Matrix. However, Matrix is an open system compared to a Hangouts chat or a
                  Slack team, so things don't line up quite the same way. What was once a specific chat room, or a
                  specific group of people in a Slack Workspace is now more nebulous.</p>
                  <p>In the new Matrix world, essentially Job Machine is just a collection of rooms on Matrix. There is
                  no strict membership list. Nothing needs to be required of a room to be a part of Job Machine other
                  than being something that you think other members of our community might want to participate in.</p>
                  <p>This will change as the Spaces feature of Matrix gets finalized (which is getting closer and closer
                  to happening!). Spaces allow for room discovery, member lists, and all the things that make a closed
                  community like a Slack team possible in Matrix. Until then, we carry on, ambiguously, in the name of
                  helping each other be better at whatever it is we're working on.
                  </p>
                  <p>UPDATE: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/17/the-matrix-space-beta">Matrix
                    Spaces have entered public Beta phase!</a> This means that Job
                  Machine has a more cohesive feel to it right now on the web, desktop, and Android
                  apps (iOS is coming). When using an app that supports Spaces, be sure to enable the Spaces beta for
                  the best experience.</p>

                  <p>Job Machine is a private community, but we aim to make accessibility easy-<i>ish</i>. Currently the Job Machine matrix server is open to federation, but all Job Machine-related rooms are need-to-know only. This means you can join with any matrix account across the federated network and participate in Job Machine. This also means that it's a little hard to find specific channels. Once the "Spaces" feature is fully developed, this should get easier.</p>

                  <p>If you're joining us for the first time, welcome! Start by joining the <code>#waitingroom:jobmachine.org</code> and introducing yourself to the admins, and they'll be able to invite you to the various private rooms we have.</p>
                  <p>UPDATE: As Spaces have entered Beta, new users will be invited to the Job Machine Space in order to
                  access and discover our many rooms. If you're using an app that doesn't support Spaces yet, it will
                  just look like a room you aren't allowed to talk in. Switch to an app that does (such as the <a
                                                                                                                   href="https://app.jobmachine.org/">webapp</a>
                  or Element on Android) to take advantage of this new feature!</p>

                  </header>
                  <p>If you forgot your password, you can reset it by visiting the <a href="https://app.mssj.me/">the web app</a> login page, and simply follow the links to reset your password. This requires that you have associated an email address with your account at some point in time... if you never have, you will need to reach out to an administrator to reset your password.<p>
                  <p>Resetting your password will cycle your encryption keys... basically that means that you won't be able to read any old messages in <a href="#encryption">encrypted rooms</a> unless you have another session logged in somewhere. If you do, you can export your encryption keys, and import them into your new sessions. For help, please reach out to an administrator.</p>

                    <h2>How do I connect with a different client instead of the webapp?</h2>
                  </header>
                  <p>There are many Matrix clients for many platforms, with a decent collection of info at <a href="https://matrix.org/clients/" target="_blank">https://matrix.org/clients/</a>.</p>
                  <p>When connecting from another client, you will need to connect to whichever homeserver your account is associated with. If you have an account on <code>jobmachine.org</code>, that would look like this:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>User ID: <code>your-username</code></li>
                    <li>Matrix ID: <code>@your-username:jobmachine.org</code></li>
                    <li>Homeserver Address: <code>https://synapse.jobmachine.org</code></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Some clients are able to figure this out just by entering your full Matrix ID, others can't. For the easiest use, we recommend you just use the <a href="https://app.jobmachine.org/" target="_blank">web app</a> which will automatically connect you to the correct homeserver.<p>
                  <p>If you're having trouble, reach out to an admin in the <code>#waitingroom:jobmachine.org</code> and someone will help sort you out.</p>

If it starts to take over and pick up steam from several people, feel free to create your own room! All it takes to make it officially part of Job Machine is letting an admin know so they can add it to our room lists.</p>
                  <p>If you create a room, you are automatically an admin of that room. Steward the room according to general Job Machine principals, and if you plan on abandoning it please ensure that you make someone else you trust an admin.</p>

                  </header>
                  <p>Matrix (the technology that powers Job Machine) supports very strong end-to-end encryption <i>if configured for the room in question</i>. Direct messages are encrypted by default, and several of our rooms are encrypted. However, many of our rooms are still bridged to a private Slack team, and that bridging would not work properly if encryption were enabled in those rooms.</p>
                  <p>To see if a room is encrypted, just look for a shield icon next to the room avatar!

                  </header>
                  <p>If you've been in any of our rooms, you've probably run into Cog, our resident bot (full matrix ID is <code>@cog:jobmachine.org</code>).</p>
                  <p>Cog can subscribe to RSS feeds, respond with an animated gif from Giphy.com, roll the dice, create polls, set reminders, and all kinds of other stuff. Just ask for help by saying <code>!help</code> in a room with Cog in it, and it will walk you through some other help commands.</p>
                  <p>Occasionally, Cog will have trouble recognizing you if you join an existing encrypted room. If you are unable to decrypt the messages that Cog is sending in that room, please let an administrator know in the <code>#waitingroom:jobmachine.org</code> and they'll give Cog a swift kick in the circuitboard.</p>

                  </header>
                  <p>No. The color of your nickname is determined by the client application using... <i>[checks notes]...</i> mysterious logic. You cannot change this unless you make changes to the code of the client application you are using.</p>

                  </header>
                  <p>Because matrix allows you to set your nickname separately from your matrix ID, there is a possibility that more than one person can have the same nickname in the same room. This would be very confusing for other people in the conversation, so matrix clients automatically show the full matrix ID to differentiate them.</p>
                  <p>If you have a conflicting nickname with someone else in the room, you are free to change your nickname so that it doesn't conflict with theirs, and the matrix client will not need to differentiate your accounts.</p>
